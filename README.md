# Coffee Machine Simulator 

This is a Coffee Machine simulation implemented in Java. The program allows users to interact with the coffee machine by performing actions such as buying coffee, refilling resources, checking remaining supplies, and taking the collected money.

## Description

The Coffee Machine program simulates the functionality of a coffee machine. It keeps track of the available resources such as water, milk, coffee beans, disposable cups, whiskey, and chocolate syrup. Users can perform the following actions:

- Buy coffee: Users can select a coffee type (Black, Latte, Cappuccino, Espresso, Americano, Macchiato, Mocha, Flat White, Irish Coffee) and the program checks if there are enough resources to make the selected coffee. If there are enough resources, the coffee is made, and the user is charged accordingly.
- Fill resources: Users can add more water, milk, coffee beans, disposable cups, whiskey, and chocolate syrup to the coffee machine. The program updates the resource levels accordingly.
- Take money: Users can collect the money that has been accumulated from previous coffee sales. The program displays the amount of money collected and resets it to zero.
- Check remaining supplies: Users can view the current levels of all the resources in the coffee machine.
- Exit: Users can choose to exit the program.

## Getting Started
